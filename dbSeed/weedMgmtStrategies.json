Always follow label instructions for herbicides. Herbicides can be applied to cut stumps with a paintbrush, wick applicator such as a dauber or \"buckthorn blaster\", or a low volume sprayer. In cases where more than a few plants are treated, add an indicator dye (available where pesticides are sold), such as Mark-It Blue, to the herbicide to mark which cut stumps you have sprayed. For basal stem treatment, a method that applies chemical through the bark, low volume spray applications can be made with Garlon 4, Pathfinder II and similar oil-based products. This application method uses triclopyr ester mixed with an oil diluent (i.e. Bark Oil Blue, kerosene) applied directly to the bark of Amur cork tree from the root collar up about 12-18 inches. An ultra-low volume spray wand should be used to minimize herbicide use and reduce the potential for non-target injury. Herbicide treatments are less effective in early spring. Summer and fall are better times for herbicide treatment with water-based herbicides such as glyphosate or triclopyr ester. Oil based herbicide such as triclopyr ester are effective during summer and fall as well as during the winter when temperatures are below freezing.",

Have a plan for what you will do with the pieces of plants you remove so that you do not spread knotweeds to new locations. Plants can be kept on site for burning or piled and covered with a tarp for decay. Be sure to monitor the site and remove any plants that sprout from the burn or decay site.

Do not cut down treated plants for at least one full growing season. Control can also be done by treating stem cross-sections immediately after cutting with a 25% solution of glyphosate or triclopyr. These are systemic herbicides that are taken up by plants and move within the plant, which can kill leaves, stems, and roots. Knotweed often grows in riparian and wetland habitats.
